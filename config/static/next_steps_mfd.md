# Next steps

Thank you for using this service to create a specification.

You can now share your specification with suppliers as part of your invitation to tender (ITT).

Consider buying from a framework recommended by DfE. This can be quicker and easier than running your own process. Each one has its own list of suppliers and has been assessed for compliance with procurement regulations, ease of use, suitability and value for money.

Go directly to view and choose from a list of <a href="https://find-dfe-approved-framework.service.gov.uk/find/type/buying/what/ict/ict-categories/mfd" target ="_blank">multi-functional devices (MFD) and printing frameworks recommended by DfE</a> in the Find a framework tool.

Or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-procedures-and-procurement-law-for-schools/find-the-right-way-to-buy"target ="_blank">read about frameworks and how to use one</a> if you haven't used one before.

## Other compliant procurement options
