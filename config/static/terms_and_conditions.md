You may use the GOV.UK website to gain access to the Service website or, in the course of using the Service, to access content on a GOV.UK website.

We might decide not to exercise or enforce any right available to us under these Terms and Conditions. We can always decide to exercise or enforce that right at a later date. Doing this once won't mean we automatically waive the right on any other occasion.

If any of these Terms and Conditions are held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal for any reason, the remaining Terms and Conditions will still apply.

### Changes to these Terms and Conditions

Please check these Terms and Conditions regularly. We can update them at any time without notice.

You will agree to any changes if you continue to use the Service after the Terms and Conditions have been updated.
