  no-op until approved

**Steps**
- implement __interrupt pattern__ which introduces a step that is not semantically
  a question but a statement
- remove `staticContent` entity and add `Statement` entity in Contentful (staging only)
- add custom answer validation logic which can be controlled in Contentful
- fix progression to the next incomplete task

- `Content::Connector` instantiates both clients
- `Content::Client` is used internally as an interface to the Contentful ruby gem
- `APP_ENV_{ENV}_CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` is replaced by
