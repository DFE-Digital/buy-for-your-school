# DfE Sign-In

**_DfE Sign-In_** `DSI` is the **_Single Sign-On_** `SSO` provider for this service.

There are [testing][test-register], [pre-production][pre-prod-register] and [production][prod-register] environments for DSI that each require registration.

## Registration

- A user with approver privileges for at least one school needs to invite you.
- [This school][phantom-school] has been used for staging access.
- Contact DfE [#digital-tools-support][digi-tools] and [#dfe_sign-in][dfe_sign-in] Slack channels for further assistance.

## Environments

This service has numerous environments and each needs to be paired and configured with a unique DfE environment.

|             | Enabled  |       DSI Env        |  DSI service management   |
| :---------- | :------: | :------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| Development | optional |     [test][test]     |   [manage][test-manage]   |
| Test        | optional |     [test][test]     |   [manage][test-manage]   |
| Staging     |   true   | [pre-prod][pre-prod] | [manage][pre-prod-manage] |
| Research    |   true   | [pre-prod][pre-prod] | [manage][pre-prod-manage] |
| Production  |   true   |     [prod][prod]     |   [manage][prod-manage]   |

DSI DNS Aliases:

- `https://interactions.signin.education.gov.uk` -> `https://services.signin.education.gov.uk`
- `https://pp-interactions.signin.education.gov.uk` -> `https://pp-services.signin.education.gov.uk`
- `https://test-interactions.signin.education.gov.uk` -> `https://test-services.signin.education.gov.uk`

## Development

In development, setting the environment variable `DFE_SIGN_IN_ENABLED` to false will bypass DSI.
You can provide _any_ value in the `UID` field to sign in.

Communicating with DSI in development requires a secure connection.

Create a self-signed certificate:

`$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -days 365 -keyout localhost.key -out localhost.crt`

Firefox will permit the use of this certificate. On OSX, Chrome will require that certificate be trusted.
In **Keychain Access** add it to the **Certificates** in the **System Keychain**.
Use `File > Import Items` and import `localhost.crt`.
Once imported change the trust level to `Always Trust`.
