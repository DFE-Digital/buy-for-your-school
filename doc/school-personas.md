# Educational Establishment Personas

A selection of real schools that can be used to develop against.

- Treat these as personas in tickets.
- Build test fixtures using the same data structures.

## TODO

Additional group data for MAT and federation is likely justification for using the GIAS API
to build out personas 3 and 4 and their respective types.
