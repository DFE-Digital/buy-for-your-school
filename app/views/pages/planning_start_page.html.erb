      <p class="govuk-body">You'll need to be aware of some of the rules, regulations and requirements that can apply to a catering contract.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Standards for school food</h3>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Procurement threshold rules</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">If, over the lifetime of your contract, the value of your provision is over the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/buying-procedures-and-procurement-law-for-schools/buying-things-that-are-over-the-eu-procurement-threshold" class="govuk-link">procurement threshold</a>, you'll need to advertise a contract notice on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-tender" class="govuk-link">Find a Tender</a> service.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">TUPE and LGPS (Local Government Pension Scheme)</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">Consider whether <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/staff-transfers-public-service-pension-schemes" class="govuk-link">TUPE</a> and LGPS will apply, especially if you're looking to outsource or come away from your local authority for the first time.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">When you give notice of termination to your current provider, you should also request details of any staff that will be subject to TUPE transfer.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This anonymised information should include:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>salary details</li>
        <li>terms conditions</li>
        <li>pension details</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You'll need confirmation from suppliers that they've had the relevant DBS checks.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">It's your responsibility to check that everyone involved in the catering contract is DBS checked.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Running the service in-house is another option. You may want to consider whether this is right for your school before you procure a contract. There are benefits and challenges to running the service yourself.</p>
      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Benefits</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">You might be able to:</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Invite your local authority to tender</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Invite your local authority to tender and involve them in the process. This way the TUPE and LGPS information must be provided during their bidding process.</p>
