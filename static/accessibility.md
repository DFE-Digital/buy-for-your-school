## **How accessible this website is**

Get help buying for schools is a new service run by the Department for Education. We’re trialling it with a limited number of users at the moment.

We have taken steps to make this service accessible:



* we designed it using the [GOV.UK accessible design principles](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/accessibility/)
* we did an audit to see if there were any accessibility issues
* we tested the design with users with accessibility needs


## **What to do if you cannot access parts of this website**

If you need information on this website in a different format, such as accessible PDF, large print, easy read, audio recording or braille, please email us on schools.digital@education.gov.uk.
